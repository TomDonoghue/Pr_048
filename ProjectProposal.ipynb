    "We are very involved in the gaming community, and all spend a lot of our free time playing video games. The gaming industry is a growing sector in the US and global economies. There are many factors present that determine a game's success, and we would like to figure out what correlates with a high number of game sales. We believe that video game sales have increased over the years, and that high review scores are correlated with more sales. Our reason to believe this is that people would see these high review scores and buy the games that were well reviewed. \n",

First is an article that describes the end of the \"golden era of video-games\" (https://qz.com/666299/the-golden-era-of-video-game-console-sales-is-over/) This is supported by data showing a decrease in console sales compared to consoles of the past. On the contrary, our second reference (http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Games_Economy-11-4-14.pdf) describes the video game industry's recent growth in the economy. We hope to figure out the truth behind this debate with our research.\n",

    "Some biases in our sources can come from the fact that earlier games have some kind of inflation with prices. Before games were about $50, but now they are about $60.
